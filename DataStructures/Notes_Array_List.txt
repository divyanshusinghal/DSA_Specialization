Array lists are backed by arrays, therefore they end up sharing a lot of its properties and limitations.

Adding to back of an array where capacity is not filled = O(1)
Adding to back of array where capacity is filled = O(n)
Amortized Analysis = O(1)*

Adding anywhere else = O(n)

Removing from the back of an array = O(1)
Removing from anywhere else in the array = O(n)

Accessing an element at a particular index = O(1)

Searching for an element in an array list (whose index is unknown) = O(n)
